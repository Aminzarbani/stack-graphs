# lsp-positions

The `lsp-positions` crate defines LSP-compatible positioning information for
source code.

When writing a tool that analyzes or operates on source code, there's a good
chance you need to interoperate with the [Language Server Protocol][lsp].  This
seemingly simple requirement makes it surprisingly difficult to deal with
_character locations_.  This is because Rust stores Unicode string content
(i.e., the source code you're analyzing) in UTF-8, while LSP specifies character
locations using [_UTF-16 code units_][lsp-utf16].

For some background, Unicode characters, or code points, are encoded as one or
more code units. In UTF-8 a code unit is 1 byte, and a character is encoded in
1–4 code units (1–4 bytes).  In UTF-16 a code unit is 2 bytes, and characters
are encoded in 1–2 code units (2 or 4 bytes). Rust strings are encoded as UTF-8,
and indexed by byte (which is the same as by code unit). Indices are only valid
if they point to the first code unit of a code point.

We keep track of each source code position using two units: the UTF-8 byte
position within the file or containing line, which can be used to index into
UTF-8 encoded `str` and `[u8]` data, and the UTF-16 code unit position within
the line, which can be used to generate `Position` values for LSP.
